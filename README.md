# Eular-Solve

Author's note

I made this repo just to help the students who like to look through different approaches to get solution for the project eular's problesm. 
I dont encourage or advice anyone to copy and solve the problems with these codes. I just want them to know how it can also be solved. 

The codes are mostly straight forward by which I mean I havent used much of mathematical formulas or special equations or anything like that
all are direct approach because you dont have to think of the time limit rather knowing how it is done. 

thank you. 
Use the solution for your betterment
